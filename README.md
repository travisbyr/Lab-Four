# Lab-

## Journal Entry #5

### What

For labs we created a Binary calculator that converts decimal numbers into Binary. By creating a simple binary calculator, we are able to easily convert decimal numbers to binary. In class we learnt about the rest paramater and spread operator. The spread operator is used to spread a value of an array accros many arguments of a function. The rest parameter is used to allow us put a number of parameters through a function that can be accesed by an array. These operators are useful for sharing data in an efficient manner over sets of code. While learning these operators and parameters we learnt how to create and use functions in an effective manner, making our code more efficent and easier to use. After learning these skillsets we were given 4 tasks to complete via peer coding.

### Why

This is useful to know as it enables us to organise and implement our code effectivly. Instead of having large lines of code that can tend to be hard to read or follow, we are able to create functions that can iniate at any time, stopping the use of us having to retype/repeat code each time we use it differently. The operators and parameters are useful to learn as it allows us to effectivly manage an array within a function.

### How

While developing these skills and learning these skillsets, I ran into issues trying to implement rest parameters and spread operators. I kept trying to access an array outside the function, which made it difficult for me to implement a solution. As I am not that familiar with functions I found it hard adapting to them. After many attempts and ideas of from online class resources, I was able to overcome this problem. Another issue I had was that this was the first time I did peer coding online. This was difficult, as me and my partner were not in a call, which made it harder to work together. Although by using a private chat we were able to overcome this issue and communicate with eachother different ways on compelting the tasks.
